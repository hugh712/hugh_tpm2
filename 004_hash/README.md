# Description
Performs a hash operation on file and returns the results.  If argument is not specified, then data is read from stdin.  If the results of the hash will be used in
a signing operation that uses a restricted signing key, then the ticket returned by this command can indicate that the hash is safe to sign.

Output defaults to stdout and binary format unless otherwise specified via -o and â€“hex options respectively.

# Usage
`tpm2_hash [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENT OR STDIN]`

# Example 1 - Hash a file with sha1 hash algorithm and save the hash and ticket to a file
`tpm2_hash -C e -g sha1 -o hash.bin -t ticket.bin data.txt`
###### -C e => set hierachy as Endorsement
###### -g sha1 => set hash algorithm as sha1, check available algorithm as `sudo tpm2_getcap algorithms`
###### -t ticket.bin ==> Optional file record of the ticket result.
###### output result to data.txt
